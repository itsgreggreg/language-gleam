## Installation

For formatting to work you must have `gleam` installed on your computer.
Follow these instructions for installing `gleam`: https://gleam.run/getting-started/

You can get this package on [Atom's Package Manager](https://atom.io/packages/language-gleam).

1. Open up Atom
1. Press `CTRL + Shift + P` inside Atom
1. Type `install package` and press enter.
1. In the search bar type `gleam` and press enter.
1. Press `Install` on the `language-gleam` package.

## Settings

To access setings for this package click on:

`Preferences -> Pagkages -> type language-gleam -> Settings`

### Format on Save

`format_on_save` is on for all gleam files by default, you can change this
by opening the package settings and un-checking `Format On Save`.

### Gleam executable absolute path

This package will try to find `gleam` automatically in your system but in case
it can't or you want to use a specific version of `gleam`, change the
`Executable` option in the settings panel to be the location of the `gleam`
executable on your computer.

If you know `gleam` is installed but formatting is not working, try running
`which gleam` in the terminal and pasting the output of that command into
`Executable`.
